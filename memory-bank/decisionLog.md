# Decision Log

This file records architectural and implementation decisions using a list format.
2025-05-22 21:15:50 - Initial memory bank creation.

*

## Decision

* Refactor example files into a simplified modular architecture

## Rationale

* Current example files are too large and not modular
* Simplified modular components will improve code reusability and maintainability
* Separation of concerns between crawling and parsing functionality
* Reduced complexity will make the system easier to understand and extend

## Implementation Details

* Will create a simplified modular architecture with the following components:
  1. Core Classes:
     - `ApiDocCrawler` - High-level orchestrator that coordinates crawling and parsing
     - `DeepCrawler` - Implements deep crawling functionality
     - `LLMParser` - Implements LLM parsing functionality
  2. Configuration Classes:
     - `CrawlerConfig` - Simple configuration for crawler parameters
     - `LLMConfig` - Simple configuration for LLM parameters with generic instructions
  3. Utility Functions:
     - Simple file operations for saving and loading content
* Will maintain compatibility with the existing crawl4ai library
* Will ensure the refactored code can be easily imported and used in other projects
* Will focus on simplicity and clarity over complex design patterns

## Updated Decision (2025-05-22 21:44:00)

* Simplified the architecture further by removing factory patterns and complex abstractions
* Focused on essential parameters and functionality in each class
* Created a generic LLM instruction that works for any API documentation type

## Implementation Plan Decision (2025-05-22 21:48:00)

* Created a detailed implementation plan with 8 phases
* Prioritized tasks based on impact and effort
* Established a timeline with dependencies between tasks
* Identified key milestones for tracking progress
* Assessed risks and defined mitigation strategies

## Phase 1 Implementation Decision (2025-05-22 21:55:00)

* Implemented a simplified class structure focusing on core functionality
* Created clear interfaces between components with minimal dependencies
* Used validation in configuration classes to ensure proper usage
* Implemented basic error handling with plans for enhancement in later phases
* Created a command-line interface for easy usage
* Added comprehensive documentation and unit tests
