This file tracks the project's current status, including recent changes, current goals, and open questions.
2025-05-22 21:15:30 - Initial memory bank creation.

*

## Current Focus

* Preparing for Phase 2 of the implementation plan: Deep Crawler Implementation
* Enhancing the DeepCrawler functionality with comprehensive error handling
* Testing the implementation with real API documentation sites

## Recent Changes

* Initialized the memory bank with basic project information
* Analyzed existing code to understand the project structure and functionality
* Designed a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
* Created an architecture diagram showing module interactions
* Simplified the architecture to focus on essential functionality
* Defined core classes with simplified interfaces
* Created a generic LLM instruction for processing any API documentation
* Developed a detailed implementation plan with phases, priorities, and timeline
* Completed Phase 1 implementation:
  - Created project structure (src, tests, config, output directories)
  - Implemented configuration classes with validation
  - Implemented core classes with basic functionality
  - Created command-line interface
  - Added unit tests for configuration classes
  - Created project documentation

## Open Questions/Issues

* How to implement proper error handling across modules (currently being addressed in Phase 2)
* How to ensure efficient caching for both crawling and LLM operations (to be addressed in later phases)
* How to handle very large API documentation sites that may require pagination (to be addressed in later phases)
* Which API documentation sites to use for testing the implementation (need to select diverse examples)
## Current Focus (2025-05-25 20:08:00)

* Successfully implemented LLM-based URL filtering system
* Enhanced the crawler with intelligent content relevance analysis
* Updated documentation and created comprehensive test examples

## Recent Changes (2025-05-25 20:08:00)

* **NEW FEATURE**: LLM-based post-crawl content filtering
  - Created `URLFilter` class for intelligent page relevance analysis
  - Integrated filtering into `ApiDocCrawler` workflow
  - Added command-line options for target topic and relevance threshold
  - Enhanced output to include relevance scores and explanations
  - Created test script demonstrating filtering capabilities
  - Updated README with comprehensive examples and documentation

* **Architecture Enhancement**: 
  - Maintained modular design while adding sophisticated filtering
  - Preserved backward compatibility (filtering is optional)
  - Added transparent relevance scoring and explanations
## Current Focus (2025-05-25 20:32:00)

* Successfully implemented dual-model LLM architecture
* Separated filtering and extraction models for optimal cost/performance balance
* Enhanced system with independent model configurations and validation

## Recent Changes (2025-05-25 20:32:00)

* **MAJOR ARCHITECTURE ENHANCEMENT**: Dual-Model LLM System
  - Created `FilterLLMConfig` class for dedicated filtering model configuration
  - Updated `URLFilter` to use separate filtering model
  - Enhanced `ApiDocCrawler` with dual-model support
  - Updated all scripts and examples to use new architecture
  - Added comprehensive validation and error handling
  - Updated environment configuration with required variables

* **Configuration Management**:
  - FILTER_LLM_PROVIDER now required for filtering functionality
  - Clear separation between extraction and filtering model settings
  - Updated .env.example and user .env with optimal model recommendations

* **Documentation and Examples**:
  - Created `dual_model_example.py` demonstrating architecture benefits
  - Updated README with dual-model setup instructions
  - Enhanced test scripts with new configuration approach
## Current Focus (2025-05-25 20:58:00)

* Successfully implemented binary URL filtering system
* Replaced relevancy scoring (0.0-1.0) with direct include/exclude decisions
* Simplified user interface by removing threshold configuration
* Maintained decision transparency through explanations

## Recent Changes (2025-05-25 20:58:00)

* **MAJOR ARCHITECTURE CHANGE**: Binary URL Filtering Implementation
  - **URLFilter class**: Transformed from scoring to binary decision system
    - Removed relevance threshold parameters and scoring logic
    - Updated LLM prompts for direct include/exclude decisions
    - Changed metadata from `relevance_score` to `included` boolean
    - Renamed explanations from `relevance_explanation` to `decision_explanation`
  
  - **ApiDocCrawler class**: Updated integration for binary filtering
    - Removed `relevance_threshold` parameters from all methods
    - Updated result handling for binary decision metadata
    - Modified save functionality for new decision format
  
  - **Command-line interface**: Simplified user experience
    - Removed `--relevance-threshold` argument
    - Updated documentation and help text
    - Streamlined main function signature

* **User Experience Enhancement**:
  - Eliminated need for threshold configuration
  - More intuitive binary include/exclude decisions
  - Maintained transparency with decision explanations
  - Simplified command-line usage
## Current Focus (2025-05-25 21:26:00)
