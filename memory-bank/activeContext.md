2025-05-22 21:15:30 - Initial memory bank creation.

*

## Current Focus

* Preparing for Phase 2 of the implementation plan: Deep Crawler Implementation
* Enhancing the DeepCrawler functionality with comprehensive error handling
* Testing the implementation with real API documentation sites

## Recent Changes

* Initialized the memory bank with basic project information
* Analyzed existing code to understand the project structure and functionality
* Designed a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
* Created an architecture diagram showing module interactions
* Simplified the architecture to focus on essential functionality
* Defined core classes with simplified interfaces
* Created a generic LLM instruction for processing any API documentation
* Developed a detailed implementation plan with phases, priorities, and timeline
* Completed Phase 1 implementation:
  - Created project structure (src, tests, config, output directories)
  - Implemented configuration classes with validation
  - Implemented core classes with basic functionality
  - Created command-line interface
  - Added unit tests for configuration classes
  - Created project documentation

## Open Questions/Issues

* How to implement proper error handling across modules (currently being addressed in Phase 2)
* How to ensure efficient caching for both crawling and LLM operations (to be addressed in later phases)
* How to handle very large API documentation sites that may require pagination (to be addressed in later phases)
* Which API documentation sites to use for testing the implementation (need to select diverse examples)
