* **MAJOR FEATURE ENHANCEMENT**: Filtering Opt-In Implementation
  - **Phase 1**: Updated command-line interface (`src/main.py`)
    - Added `--enable-filtering` flag with proper validation
    - Updated main function signature to support filtering control
    - Added error handling for invalid flag combinations
    - Enhanced help text and documentation
  
  - **Phase 2**: Enhanced ApiDocCrawler class (`src/api_doc_crawler.py`)
    - Added `filtering_enabled` parameter to constructor
    - Modified filtering logic to be conditional on explicit enablement
    - Updated URLFilter initialization to only occur when needed
    - Enhanced all filtering methods to check enablement status
  
  - **Phase 3**: Comprehensive testing and validation
    - Created test script to validate all functionality
    - Tested command-line argument combinations
    - Verified error handling works correctly
    - Confirmed both filtering enabled and disabled scenarios work
    - Validated backward compatibility for programmatic usage

* **Architecture Improvement**:
  - **Performance optimization**: No LLM calls when filtering disabled
  - **Cost control**: Filter LLM API usage only when explicitly requested
  - **User experience**: Clear, explicit control over filtering behavior
  - **Backward compatibility**: Existing code continues to work unchanged

* **Validation Results**:
  - ✅ Default behavior: No filtering, all pages kept
  - ✅ Error case: `--enable-filtering` without `--target-topic` shows clear error
  - ✅ Filtering enabled: Both flags together enable LLM-based filtering
  - ✅ Target topic only: No filtering applied when `--enable-filtering` not used
  - ✅ Help text: Shows new flag with proper documentation
