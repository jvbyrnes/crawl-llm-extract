2025-05-22 21:15:40 - Initial memory bank creation.

*

## Completed Tasks

* Analyzed existing code to understand the project structure
* Initialized memory bank with project information
* Designed a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
* Created an architecture diagram showing module interactions
* Simplified the architecture to focus on essential functionality
* Defined the core classes and their interfaces
* Created a detailed implementation plan with 8 phases
* Completed Phase 1: Core Structure Setup
  - Created project structure (src, tests, config, output directories)
  - Implemented configuration classes (CrawlerConfig, LLMConfig)
  - Implemented core class skeletons with interfaces (DeepCrawler, LLMParser, ApiDocCrawler)
  - Created main.py script for command-line interface
  - Added unit tests for configuration classes
  - Created README.md and requirements.txt

## Current Tasks

* Prepare for Phase 2: Deep Crawler Implementation
* Review and refine the current implementation

## Next Steps

* Complete Phase 2: Deep Crawler Implementation
  - Enhance DeepCrawler functionality
  - Add comprehensive error handling for crawler

* Proceed to Phase 3: LLM Parser Implementation
  - Enhance LLMParser functionality
  - Add comprehensive error handling for parser

* Follow the implementation plan through the remaining phases as outlined in implementationPlan.md
## Completed Tasks (2025-05-25 20:08:00)

* **MAJOR FEATURE**: Implemented LLM-based URL filtering system
  - Created `URLFilter` class with intelligent relevance analysis
  - Enhanced `ApiDocCrawler` with post-crawl filtering capabilities
  - Updated command-line interface with new filtering options
  - Created comprehensive test script and updated documentation
  - Successfully addresses user's need for precise content targeting

* **Enhanced Architecture**:
  - Maintained modular design principles

  - Preserved backward compatibility
  - Integrated seamlessly with existing LLM configuration
## Completed Tasks (2025-05-25 20:58:00)

* **MAJOR FEATURE ENHANCEMENT**: Binary URL Filtering System
  - **Phase 1**: Updated URLFilter class for binary decisions
    - Removed relevancy scoring logic and threshold parameters
    - Implemented direct include/exclude LLM prompts
    - Updated response parsing for binary decisions
    - Changed metadata structure from scores to boolean flags
  
  - **Phase 2**: Updated ApiDocCrawler integration
    - Removed relevance threshold parameters from all methods
    - Updated result handling for binary decision metadata
    - Modified save functionality for new decision format
  
  - **Phase 3**: Updated command-line interface
    - Removed `--relevance-threshold` argument
    - Simplified main function signature
    - Updated documentation and help text

* **Architecture Simplification**:
  - Eliminated complex threshold configuration
  - Streamlined user experience with binary decisions
  - Maintained decision transparency through explanations
  - Reduced API complexity while preserving functionality
