2025-05-22 21:15:40 - Initial memory bank creation.

*

## Completed Tasks

* Analyzed existing code to understand the project structure
* Initialized memory bank with project information
* Designed a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
* Created an architecture diagram showing module interactions
* Simplified the architecture to focus on essential functionality
* Defined the core classes and their interfaces
* Created a detailed implementation plan with 8 phases
* Completed Phase 1: Core Structure Setup
  - Created project structure (src, tests, config, output directories)
  - Implemented configuration classes (CrawlerConfig, LLMConfig)
  - Implemented core class skeletons with interfaces (DeepCrawler, LLMParser, ApiDocCrawler)
  - Created main.py script for command-line interface
  - Added unit tests for configuration classes
  - Created README.md and requirements.txt

## Current Tasks

* Prepare for Phase 2: Deep Crawler Implementation
* Review and refine the current implementation

## Next Steps

* Complete Phase 2: Deep Crawler Implementation
  - Enhance DeepCrawler functionality
  - Add comprehensive error handling for crawler

* Proceed to Phase 3: LLM Parser Implementation
  - Enhance LLMParser functionality
  - Add comprehensive error handling for parser

* Follow the implementation plan through the remaining phases as outlined in implementationPlan.md
