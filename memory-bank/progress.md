2025-05-22 21:15:40 - Initial memory bank creation.

*

## Completed Tasks

* Analyzed existing code to understand the project structure
* Initialized memory bank with project information
* Designed a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
* Created an architecture diagram showing module interactions
* Simplified the architecture to focus on essential functionality
* Defined the core classes and their interfaces
* Created a detailed implementation plan with 8 phases
* Completed Phase 1: Core Structure Setup
  - Created project structure (src, tests, config, output directories)
  - Implemented configuration classes (CrawlerConfig, LLMConfig)
  - Implemented core class skeletons with interfaces (DeepCrawler, LLMParser, ApiDocCrawler)
  - Created main.py script for command-line interface
  - Added unit tests for configuration classes
  - Created README.md and requirements.txt

## Current Tasks

* Prepare for Phase 2: Deep Crawler Implementation
* Review and refine the current implementation

## Next Steps

* Complete Phase 2: Deep Crawler Implementation
  - Enhance DeepCrawler functionality
  - Add comprehensive error handling for crawler

* Proceed to Phase 3: LLM Parser Implementation
  - Enhance LLMParser functionality
  - Add comprehensive error handling for parser

* Follow the implementation plan through the remaining phases as outlined in implementationPlan.md
## Completed Tasks (2025-05-25 20:08:00)

* **MAJOR FEATURE**: Implemented LLM-based URL filtering system
  - Created `URLFilter` class with intelligent relevance analysis
  - Enhanced `ApiDocCrawler` with post-crawl filtering capabilities
  - Updated command-line interface with new filtering options
  - Created comprehensive test script and updated documentation
  - Successfully addresses user's need for precise content targeting

* **Enhanced Architecture**:
  - Maintained modular design principles
  - Added transparent relevance scoring system
  - Preserved backward compatibility
  - Integrated seamlessly with existing LLM configuration
## Completed Tasks (2025-05-25 20:58:00)

* **MAJOR FEATURE ENHANCEMENT**: Binary URL Filtering System
  - **Phase 1**: Updated URLFilter class for binary decisions
    - Removed relevancy scoring logic and threshold parameters
    - Implemented direct include/exclude LLM prompts
    - Updated response parsing for binary decisions
    - Changed metadata structure from scores to boolean flags
  
  - **Phase 2**: Updated ApiDocCrawler integration
    - Removed relevance threshold parameters from all methods
    - Updated result handling for binary decision metadata
    - Modified save functionality for new decision format
  
  - **Phase 3**: Updated command-line interface
    - Removed `--relevance-threshold` argument
    - Simplified main function signature
    - Updated documentation and help text

* **Architecture Simplification**:
  - Eliminated complex threshold configuration
  - Streamlined user experience with binary decisions
  - Maintained decision transparency through explanations
  - Reduced API complexity while preserving functionality
## Completed Tasks (2025-05-26 17:39:00)

* **MAJOR FEATURE ENHANCEMENT**: Filtering Opt-In Implementation
  - **Phase 1**: Updated command-line interface (`src/main.py`)
    - Added `--enable-filtering` flag with proper validation
    - Updated main function signature to support filtering control
    - Added error handling for invalid flag combinations
    - Enhanced help text and documentation
  
  - **Phase 2**: Enhanced ApiDocCrawler class (`src/api_doc_crawler.py`)
    - Added `filtering_enabled` parameter to constructor
    - Modified filtering logic to be conditional on explicit enablement
    - Updated URLFilter initialization to only occur when needed
    - Enhanced all filtering methods to check enablement status
  
  - **Phase 3**: Comprehensive testing and validation
    - Created test script to validate all functionality
    - Tested command-line argument combinations
    - Verified error handling works correctly
    - Confirmed both filtering enabled and disabled scenarios work
    - Validated backward compatibility for programmatic usage

* **Architecture Improvement**:
  - **Performance optimization**: No LLM calls when filtering disabled
  - **Cost control**: Filter LLM API usage only when explicitly requested
  - **User experience**: Clear, explicit control over filtering behavior
  - **Backward compatibility**: Existing code continues to work unchanged

* **Validation Results**:
  - ✅ Default behavior: No filtering, all pages kept
  - ✅ Error case: `--enable-filtering` without `--target-topic` shows clear error
  - ✅ Filtering enabled: Both flags together enable LLM-based filtering
  - ✅ Target topic only: No filtering applied when `--enable-filtering` not used
  - ✅ Help text: Shows new flag with proper documentation
