# Binary URL Filtering Migration Guide

**Date**: 2025-05-25  
**Change**: URL filtering system changed from relevancy scores to binary include/exclude decisions

## Overview

The URL filtering system has been simplified from a scoring-based approach (0.0-1.0 relevancy scores with configurable thresholds) to a direct binary include/exclude decision system.

## What Changed

### Before (Relevancy Scoring)
```python
# Command line usage
python -m src.main https://example.com --target-topic "Python SDK" --relevance-threshold 0.8

# API usage
results = await crawler.crawl_and_parse(url, relevance_threshold=0.8)

# Result metadata
{
    "url": "https://example.com/page",
    "relevance_score": 0.85,
    "relevance_explanation": "Highly relevant to Python SDK"
}
```

### After (Binary Decisions)
```python
# Command line usage
python -m src.main https://example.com --target-topic "Python SDK"

# API usage  
results = await crawler.crawl_and_parse(url)

# Result metadata
{
    "url": "https://example.com/page", 
    "included": true,
    "decision_explanation": "Contains Python SDK documentation"
}
```

## Migration Steps

### 1. Update Command Line Usage
**Remove the `--relevance-threshold` parameter:**

```bash
# OLD
python -m src.main https://docs.example.com --target-topic "Python SDK" --relevance-threshold 0.7

# NEW
python -m src.main https://docs.example.com --target-topic "Python SDK"
```

### 2. Update API Calls
**Remove relevance_threshold parameters:**

```python
# OLD
results = await crawler.crawl_and_parse(url, relevance_threshold=0.8)
crawl_results = await crawler.crawl_only(url, relevance_threshold=0.7)

# NEW
results = await crawler.crawl_and_parse(url)
crawl_results = await crawler.crawl_only(url)
```

### 3. Update Result Processing
**Change metadata field names:**

```python
# OLD
for result in results:
    if 'relevance_score' in result:
        score = result['relevance_score']
        explanation = result['relevance_explanation']
        print(f"Score: {score}, Reason: {explanation}")

# NEW
for result in results:
    if 'included' in result:
        included = result['included']
        explanation = result['decision_explanation']
        print(f"Included: {included}, Reason: {explanation}")
```

## Benefits of Binary Approach

1. **Simplified Configuration**: No need to tune threshold values
2. **Clearer Decisions**: Include/exclude is more intuitive than numeric scores
3. **Reduced Complexity**: Eliminates threshold management logic
4. **Better LLM Performance**: Binary decisions may be more reliable
5. **Cost Efficiency**: Simpler prompts may reduce token usage
6. **Maintained Transparency**: Still provides decision explanations

## LLM Prompt Changes

### Before (Scoring)
```
Please evaluate how relevant this page is to the target topic on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0:
- 1.0 = Highly relevant, directly related to the target topic
- 0.7-0.9 = Moderately relevant, contains useful related information
- 0.4-0.6 = Somewhat relevant, tangentially related
- 0.1-0.3 = Minimally relevant, barely related
- 0.0 = Not relevant, unrelated to the target topic

Respond in this exact JSON format:
{
    "relevance_score": 0.8,
    "explanation": "Brief explanation of why this page is or isn't relevant"
}
```

### After (Binary)
```
Make a binary decision based on relevance to the target topic.

Respond in this exact JSON format:
{
    "decision": "include",
    "explanation": "Brief explanation of why this page should be included or excluded"
}

The "decision" field must be exactly "include" or "exclude".
```

## Testing Your Migration

Use the provided test script to verify the new binary filtering works:

```bash
python test_binary_filtering.py
```

This will:
- Test the new binary decision system
- Verify metadata format changes
- Confirm old scoring fields are removed
- Show example include/exclude decisions

## Backward Compatibility

⚠️ **Breaking Change**: This is a breaking change that requires code updates.

**Not supported:**
- `--relevance-threshold` command line argument
- `relevance_threshold` parameters in API methods
- `relevance_score` and `relevance_explanation` in results

**Migration timeline:**
- Update your scripts to remove threshold parameters
- Update result processing to use new metadata fields
- Test with the new binary system

## Support

If you encounter issues during migration:
1. Check that you've removed all `relevance_threshold` parameters
2. Update result processing to use `included` and `decision_explanation` fields
3. Run the test script to verify functionality
4. Review the implementation plan in `memory-bank/binary-filtering-implementation-plan.md`

## Example Migration

### Complete Before/After Example

```python
# BEFORE - Relevancy Scoring Approach
import asyncio
from src.config import CrawlerConfig, LLMConfig, FilterLLMConfig
from src.api_doc_crawler import ApiDocCrawler

async def old_approach():
    crawler = ApiDocCrawler(
        crawler_config=CrawlerConfig(),
        llm_config=LLMConfig(),
        filter_llm_config=FilterLLMConfig(),
        target_topic="Python SDK documentation"
    )
    
    # OLD: Used relevance threshold
    results = await crawler.crawl_and_parse(
        "https://docs.example.com", 
        relevance_threshold=0.7
    )
    
    # OLD: Processed relevance scores
    for result in results:
        score = result.get('relevance_score', 0)
        explanation = result.get('relevance_explanation', '')
        if score >= 0.7:
            print(f"✅ Included (score: {score}): {result['url']}")
        else:
            print(f"❌ Excluded (score: {score}): {result['url']}")

# AFTER - Binary Decision Approach  
async def new_approach():
    crawler = ApiDocCrawler(
        crawler_config=CrawlerConfig(),
        llm_config=LLMConfig(), 
        filter_llm_config=FilterLLMConfig(),
        target_topic="Python SDK documentation"
    )
    
    # NEW: No threshold needed
    results = await crawler.crawl_and_parse("https://docs.example.com")
    
    # NEW: Process binary decisions
    for result in results:
        included = result.get('included', True)
        explanation = result.get('decision_explanation', '')
        if included:
            print(f"✅ Included: {result['url']}")
        else:
            print(f"❌ Excluded: {result['url']}")
        print(f"   Reason: {explanation}")
```

The new approach is simpler, more intuitive, and eliminates the need for threshold configuration while maintaining full transparency through decision explanations.
